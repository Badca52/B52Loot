## Community Sentiment

- **Positive**: Users appreciate visible ground loot as alternative to Ravage's inventory system (ROBAX). Mod fills a genuine need in the Arma 3 survival/sandbox community.
- **Negative**: Frustration over years of no updates (2017-2024). Config errors on every load. Perception of abandonment.
- **Constructive**: Dark reminded community to be supportive rather than hostile toward the developer.
- **Most requested**: Custom loot tables, weapon+magazine pairing, mod compatibility (CUP/RHS/ACE).

## Workshop Status

The mod page shows a removal notice for violating Steam Community & Content Guidelines and is flagged as incompatible with Arma 3. This may need to be addressed to restore the listing.
